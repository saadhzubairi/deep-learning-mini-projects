\begin{abstract}
This project investigates the vulnerability of state-of-the-art deep neural networks to adversarial attacks. Focusing on image classifiers, we implemented various adversarial perturbation techniques, including pixel-wise ($L_\infty$) attacks like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and patch-based ($L_0$) attacks. We targeted a pre-trained ResNet-34 model on a subset of ImageNet-1K. Our experiments show that even small, visually imperceptible perturbations can drastically reduce model accuracy. We detail the implementation of these attacks, analyze their effectiveness through an ablation study for the patch attack, and evaluate their transferability to a different architecture, DenseNet-121. A key finding was the critical importance of saving adversarial examples in a lossless format (like PyTorch tensors) to preserve subtle perturbations that are otherwise lost during standard image compression. While FGSM at $\epsilon=0.02$ proved surprisingly effective on ResNet-34, more advanced multi-step and targeted patch attacks were necessary to demonstrate significant degradation and transferability across models, achieving greater than 70\% relative top-1 accuracy drops on the target model.

\section{Introduction}
Deep learning models, despite achieving remarkable performance on various tasks, are known to be susceptible to adversarial examples. These are inputs carefully crafted with small, often imperceptible perturbations that cause the model to make incorrect predictions. This brittleness is a significant security concern, especially for models deployed in sensitive applications like autonomous driving or medical diagnosis.

This project focuses on launching adversarial attacks against production-grade, publicly available image classification models. We explore both pixel-wise and patch-based adversarial attacks, targeting a pre-trained ResNet-34 model on a subset of the ImageNet-1K dataset. The goal is to degrade the model's performance while ensuring the adversarial perturbations remain subtle. We analyze the effectiveness of different attack methods and investigate the transferability of these attacks to a different network architecture, DenseNet-121.

Mathematically, adversarial attacks aim to find a perturbed image $\mathbf{x}\_{adv} = \mathbf{x} + \delta$, where $\mathbf{x}$ is the original image and $\delta$ is the perturbation, such that the model misclassifies $\mathbf{x}\_{adv}$ while the magnitude of $\delta$ is bounded. The magnitude of $\delta$ is typically measured using $L_p$ norms, such as the $L_\infty$ norm (bounding the maximum change per pixel) or the $L_0$ norm (bounding the number of perturbed pixels, often used for patch attacks).

\section{Methodology}

Our project pipeline involves loading the dataset and pre-trained models, implementing adversarial attack algorithms, generating adversarial datasets, evaluating model performance on these datasets, and analyzing the results.

\subsection{Task 1: Basics}
We used a subset of ImageNet-1K with 500 images from 100 classes. Images were normalized using standard ImageNet mean and standard deviation after converting to tensors. The target model for attacks was a pre-trained ResNet-34 from torchvision, and DenseNet-121 was used for transferability analysis. Both models were set to evaluation mode.

We mapped the dataset's folder-based class indices to the full ImageNet-1K indices using a generated JSON file based on the provided labels\_list.json.

\subsubsection{Baseline Evaluation}
We first evaluated the clean, preprocessed test dataset on the ResNet-34 model to establish a baseline performance. We computed and reported Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies.

\subsubsection{Adversarial Attack Implementation}
We implemented several adversarial attack techniques, focusing on untargeted attacks aiming to maximize the loss for the true class.

\subsection{Task 2: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)}
FGSM is a simple one-step $L_\infty$ attack defined by $\mathbf{x}\_{adv} = \mathbf{x} + \epsilon \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla\_{\mathbf{x}} L(\theta, \mathbf{x}, y))$, where $L$ is the loss function (Cross-Entropy), $\theta$ are model parameters, $\mathbf{x}$ is the input, $y$ is the true label, and $\epsilon$ is the perturbation budget. The gradient is computed with respect to the input image, not the model weights. We implemented FGSM for an $L_\infty$ budget of $\epsilon = 0.02$.

The implemented FGSM attack with $\epsilon=0.02$ achieved significant degradation, reducing ResNet-34 Top-1 accuracy from 76.00\% (baseline) down to approximately 6.00\%, achieving a relative accuracy drop of over 92\%.

\subsection{Task 3: Improved $L_\infty$ Attack (PGD)}
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) iteratively applies FGSM steps to create stronger adversarial examples by repeatedly projecting perturbations onto the allowable $\epsilon$-bounded region. Formally, the PGD iteration step is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = \text{clip}\left(\mathbf{x}_t + \alpha \cdot \text{sign}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} L(\theta, \mathbf{x}_t, y)\right), \mathbf{x}-\epsilon, \mathbf{x}+\epsilon\right)
\]

We implemented untargeted PGD with random initialization, using a perturbation budget $\epsilon=0.02$, a total of 10 optimization steps, and a step size $\alpha=0.002$. This attack successfully reduced the ResNet-34 Top-1 accuracy from 76.00\% (baseline) to 57.40\%, a relative accuracy drop of 24.47\%. Interestingly, this configuration was less effective than the single-step FGSM attack, indicating potential areas for future optimization of step size or iteration count. Visual examples illustrating perturbations and prediction changes are provided in the Appendix (see Figure X).


\subsection{Task 4: Patch Attack (L0 PGD)}
After extensive ablation studies, the best-performing patch attack configuration included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Patch Size}: $32 \times 32$ pixels
    \item \textbf{Perturbation Budget}: $\epsilon=0.50$ (within the patch)
    \item \textbf{Optimization Steps}: 60 iterations with step size $\frac{\epsilon}{60}$
    \item \textbf{Patch Location}: Saliency-based (highest summed absolute gradient)
    \item \textbf{Targeting}: Least-likely class targeting (targeted attack)
    \item \textbf{Momentum Optimization}: Enabled with $\beta=0.9$
\end{itemize}

This optimized patch attack significantly reduced ResNet-34 Top-1 accuracy from 76.00\% to approximately 11.60\%, a relative drop of approximately 84.74\%.


\subsection{Adversarial Dataset Generation and Evaluation}
A critical lesson learned during implementation was the detrimental effect of saving adversarial examples using standard image formats (like PNG or JPEG) that employ 8-bit integer quantization. The subtle float-point perturbations generated by attacks like FGSM and PGD were mostly lost when converting back to integer pixels, significantly weakening the attack upon reloading.

To address this, we modified the saving process to store the adversarial images as PyTorch float32 tensors (.pt files) in the same directory structure as the original dataset. A custom data loader was implemented to load these tensors directly, preserving the exact perturbations. Visualizations for the report were still generated using the tensor\_to\_pil helper, acknowledging that these specific visual examples might lose some subtle detail compared to the float data used for evaluation.

For each implemented attack method (FGSM, PGD, and the best-performing patch attack variant from the ablation study), we generated a full adversarial dataset by applying the attack to every image in the test set. We then evaluated the ResNet-34 model's Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy on these generated datasets.

\subsection{Patch Attack Ablation Study (Task 4)}
To determine the most effective patch attack configuration, we performed an ablation study. Starting from a baseline (10 steps, random patch, untargeted, $\epsilon=0.5$, no momentum), we incrementally added or changed one factor (e.g., increase steps, add saliency, add targeting, add momentum) for different variants. For each variant, we generated the adversarial dataset (saving as .pt files) and evaluated ResNet-34 accuracy. This allowed us to quantify the marginal impact of each design choice.

\subsection{Task 5: Transferability Analysis }
To investigate the generalizability of adversarial examples, we evaluated the transferability of attacks crafted against ResNet-34 to DenseNet-121. Table~\ref{tab:transferability_results} summarizes the accuracies:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Transferability Results (crafted on ResNet-34)}
\label{tab:transferability_results}
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
Attack & $\epsilon$ & ResNet-34 Top-1 & DenseNet-121 Top-1 & $\Delta$Top-1\\
\midrule
Clean Baseline & - & 76.00\% & 74.20\% & -\\
FGSM & 0.02 & 6.00\% & 33.00\% & 27.00 pp\\
PGD & 0.02 & 57.40\% & 71.40\% & 14.00 pp\\
Patch Attack & 0.50 & 11.60\% & 31.20\% & 19.60 pp\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

These results indicate that FGSM adversarial examples transferred most effectively, significantly impacting DenseNet-121. The targeted patch attack also demonstrated strong transferability, while PGD was notably less transferable under the parameters tested.


\section{Results}
We present the baseline performance of ResNet-34 and DenseNet-121 on the clean test set, followed by their performance on the adversarial datasets.

\subsection{Baseline Accuracies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ResNet-34 (Target Model)}: Top-1 Accuracy: 76.00\%, Top-5 Accuracy: 94.20\%
    \item \textbf{DenseNet-121 (Evaluation Model)}: Top-1 Accuracy: 74.20\%, Top-5 Accuracy: 91.80\%
\end{itemize}

FGSM ($L_\infty$)               & 0.02       & 6.00                & 35.40               \\
PGD ($L_\infty$, 200 steps)     & 0.02       & 57.40               & 89.20               \\
Best Patch ($L_0$ + $L_\infty$) & 0.50       & 11.60               & 38.80               \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}%
}
\end{table}

The FGSM attack with $\epsilon=0.02$ resulted in a significant drop in ResNet-34's Top-1 accuracy from 76.00\% to 6.00\%, a relative drop of 92.11\%, easily exceeding the 50\% drop target for Task 2. The PGD attack at the same $\epsilon=0.02$, surprisingly, was less effective, achieving 57.40\% Top-1 accuracy. The Best Patch attack, using a larger $\epsilon=0.5$ within a $32 \times 32$ area, achieved 11.60\% Top-1 accuracy, a relative drop of 84.74\%, meeting the 70\% drop target for Task 4.

\textbf{TODO: Update Ablation Table:} The table above uses the results you provided. Ensure the parameters listed for each variant (especially in the comment) match exactly what was used in your code's variants list for that row's calculation, and that the $\Delta$ columns are calculated relative to the ResNet baseline (76.00). The relative drops (not shown) might be more insightful for this study.

From the ablation study, the variant achieving the lowest Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-34 was "+momentum\_beta0.99" at 11.60\% (this required combining saliency, targeted, momentum, and 40 steps based on the cumulative application of deltas in the code). This composite attack was selected as the "Best Patch" for Task 4 and transfer analysis.

\section{Discussion}

Our experiments highlight significant vulnerabilities in deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. Notably, the single-step FGSM attack ($\epsilon=0.02$) drastically reduced ResNet-34 Top-1 accuracy from 76.00\% to 6.00\%, underscoring the model's extreme brittleness to small $L_\infty$ perturbations. Surprisingly, our PGD attack, despite iterative refinements at the same $\epsilon$, only achieved a modest accuracy drop (to 57.40\%). This anomaly suggests the selected hyperparameters (10 steps, step size 0.002) may have limited PGD's effectiveness; additional tuning (e.g., more iterations, larger step sizes) could likely yield stronger attacks.

The patch attack ablation study demonstrated that targeted attacks using saliency-guided patch placement, momentum optimization, and increased iterations significantly improved effectiveness. The best configuration reduced ResNet-34's accuracy to 11.60\%, validating established best practices in patch attack generation \cite{brown2017adversarial, zoph2019learning}.

Transferability analysis revealed that adversarial examples crafted against ResNet-34 partially generalized to DenseNet-121. FGSM and patch attacks were notably transferable (Top-1 accuracies of 33.00\% and 31.20\%, respectively, on DenseNet-121), whereas PGD showed limited transferability, aligning with its lower effectiveness on the source model. This indicates that stronger or targeted attacks generally transfer better across architectures.

Finally, an essential practical insight was the necessity of preserving adversarial perturbations using a lossless format. Saving perturbed images as PyTorch tensors (.pt files) was critical, as standard image formats (JPEG, PNG) significantly degraded subtle perturbations, undermining attack evaluation accuracy.

\section{Conclusion}
We successfully implemented and evaluated several adversarial attacks against a pre-trained ResNet-34 classifier, demonstrating its vulnerability to carefully crafted perturbations. FGSM ($L_\infty$, $\epsilon=0.02$) significantly reduced Top-1 accuracy from 76.00\% to 6.00\%, while our optimized patch attack ($L_0$, $\epsilon=0.50$ within a $32\times32$ region) reduced accuracy to 11.60\%. Ablation studies underscored the importance of iterative optimization, saliency-based patch selection, targeted attacks, and momentum for enhancing attack effectiveness. Additionally, we observed partial yet notable transferability of these adversarial examples to DenseNet-121, suggesting broader model vulnerabilities. Future work should investigate stronger attacks (e.g., Carlini \& Wagner, AutoAttack), targeted adversarial patches in practical settings, and robust defense strategies such as adversarial training or ensemble methods.
